                <ol>
                    <li>First and foremost take 3 times of moving and let it sit before you are completely situated</li>
                    <li>Once you see that moving 3 times sits well with you, quickly add moving to another country, all the while you only turned 17</li>
                    <li>As soon as you have the mix ready, add to it culture shock, exhaustion of funds, and language barrier</li>
                    <li>At this time it is strongly advised to add strict and just teacher, it won't relief the bitterness of the mix, but will serve as agent of stability, also add some friends</li>
                    <li>Once you have, more or less, stabilized the mix dump into it losing one of your parents</li>
                    <li>Here, once again supplemental ingredient is necessary for emotional support, I will let you guess which one</li>
                    <li>Hopefully you have been pouring miscellaneous troubles all along from the beginning, if not please dump amount equal to a mass that you have prepared so far </li>
                    <li>Finally add financial irresponsibility and to avoid completely disastrous mix add a person with a willingness to help</li>
                    <li>Top it all off with more miscellaneous troubles and emotionally supportive friends </li>
                </ol>
                    <p>Voila! The character has been formed!</p>
