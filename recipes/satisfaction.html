    <h3><strong>Description</strong></h3>
         <p>
        Ever wondered what it would be like to be internally satisfied? Not in the sexual way but more like the comfort within, warm, soft and fluffy feeling. Well, I have got the exact recipe for this feeling. All you need to do is to have the ingredients ready and follow the steps below.
         </p>

    <h3><strong>Ingredients</strong></h3>
         <p>
           <ul>
               <li>Lack of 9 to 5 job - 1 piece</li>
               <li>Keeping same routine - at least 1 year</li>
               <li>New camping gear, that was bought last Christmas - 1 piece</li>
               <li>Promise to yourself to travel at least once a year - 1 piece</li>
               <li>Significant other - 1 piece</li>
               <li>Kids - how ever many you can take (optional)
                <li>Plane ticket - 2 piece </li>
               <li>Destination - 1 island with mountains</li>
           </ul>     
          </p>
          <h3><strong>Steps</strong></h3>
          <p>
              <ol>
                  <li> Take "keeping same routine" and "promise to yourself to travel at least once a year" and mix them until you get the "I am sick of this, I need to go somewhere to see new things" homogeneous blend  </li>
                  <li>Then add to the mix "new camping gear, that was bought last Christmas" and make sure it still has dust on it from laying on the highest shelf in the garage. </li>
                  <li>Prepare your "significant other" and add to the mix, at this stage it is optional to add "kids", if you abstain from adding "kids", make sure they are set for the time you are away, supervision and such. </li>
                  <li>Finally let the mix ferment for at least 14 days before you add "plane tickets" and "destination" and once it is well fermented, mix all of the ingredients together and pour it into a tall glass of "I can't believe we are doing this"</li>

                <p> P.S. "Satisfaction within" is best when served right after "I hope we did not forget anything"</p>

              </ol>
